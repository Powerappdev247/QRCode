        <p>Remember to read this and smile from within when you are having a busy day.
            Oh! I want you to read it everyday 😂</p>
            
          <p>I have profiled you 😂 and what can I say? 
            You are my man that used to send sweet mails once upon a time 😂.
            You are a happy person by default and you are so full of life. The most beautiful part is that the devil does not have what it takes to take that away from you. 
            I think I finally figured out why you claim not to love parties. I mean, for someone who deserves to be celebrated every single day, getting bored of routine is totally understandable. Don't forget to pop wine casually sha 😌. 
            
            You'll find a lot of happy emoji here because I am happy writing this. It's from my heart 🤗.</p>
            
          <p>I hope this gift encourages you to chase your dreams boldly and unapologetically. </p>
            
         <p>Thank you for being one of the few most important people in my life. Thanks for believing in me and always cheering. You are the best. 
            Thank you for always expressing your financial concerns about me 😂, it has made me more conscious and willing to work on them. </p> 
            
          <p>Thank you for the MICHAEL effect, you've really rubbed off on me 🥺.
            Thank you for being so selfless, now I wonder if there's a better way to love other than that. 
            Thank you for consciously and subconsciously loving me. 
            I love the way you love me. Thank you for all the efforts you put in. </p> 
            
         <p>I love you so much, Micheal Tómilọ́ba. 
            Happy birthday, Baby boo 
            </p>
